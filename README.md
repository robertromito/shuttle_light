# Shuttle Light

Fun side project to control an [Elgato Ring Light](https://www.elgato.com/en/ring-light) using a [ShuttleXpress](https://www.contourdesign.ca/product/shuttlexpress/) jog wheel controller thingy

`shuttle_light` is a TUI built with python, [Requests](https://realpython.com/python-requests/), and [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html).

Once I get the python version all spit and polished, I'll try building in Rust.
